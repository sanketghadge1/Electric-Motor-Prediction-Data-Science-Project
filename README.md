# Electric-Motor-Prediction-Data-Science-Project
This project uses machine learning to predict when an electric motor might fail based on sensor data like temperature, vibration, and power usage. By analyzing patterns, we can help industries prevent breakdowns, reduce maintenance costs, and improve efficiency.
